\beginverse
How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the canonballs fly
Before they're for ever banned?
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind.
\endchorus

\beginverse
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will take till he knows
That too many people have died?
\endverse

\beginverse
How many years can a mountain exist
Before he is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
\endverse
