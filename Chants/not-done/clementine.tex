\beginverse
In a cavern, in a canyon,
Excavating for a mine,
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner,
And his daughter Clementine.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
\bis{Oh my darling,}
Oh my darling, Clementine!
Thou art lost and gone forever,
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Light she was an like a fairy,
And her shoes were number nine;
Herringboxes, without topses,
Sandals were for Clementine.
\endverse

\beginverse
Drove her ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning, just at nine;
Hit her foot against a splinter,
Fell into the foaming brine.
\endverse

\beginverse
Saw her lips above the water
Blowing bubbles mighty fine;
But alas I was no swimmer,
So I lost my Clementine.
\endverse

\beginverse
In a corner of the churchyard,
Where the myrtle boughs entwine,
Grow the roses in their posies,
Fertilized by Clementine.
\endverse

\beginverse
Then the miner, forty-niner,
Soon began to peak and pine;
Thought he "oughter join" his daughter,
Now he's with his Clementine.
\endverse

\beginverse
In my dreams she still doth hount me
Robed in garments, soaked in brine,
Though in life I used to hug her,
Now she's dead I draw the line.
\endverse

\beginverse
How I missed her, how I missed her,
How I missed my Clementine!
But I kissed her little sister,
And forgot my Clementine.
\endverse
