\beginverse
In Dublin's fair city,
Where the girls are so pretty,
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone,
And she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through streets broad ad narrow,
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
Crying : "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!"
\bis{Alive, alive o-oh!}
Crying : "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!"
\endchorus

\beginverse
She was a fishmonger,
But sure 't was no wonder,
For so were her father and mother before;
And they each wheeled their barrow
Through streets broad and narrow,
\endverse

\beginverse
She died of a fever
And no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone;
Her ghost wheels her barrow
Through streets broad and narrow,
\endverse
