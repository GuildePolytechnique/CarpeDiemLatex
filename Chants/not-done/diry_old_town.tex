\beginverse
I met my love by the gas works wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed a girl by the factory wall

\beginverse
Clouds a drifting across the moon
Cats a prowling on their beat
Spring's a girl in the street at night

\endverse

\beginverse
Heard a siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
\bis{Dirty old town.}
\endverse

\beginverse
I'm going t make me a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
\bis{Dirty old town.}
