\beginverse
On a wagon bound for market
There 's a calf with a mournful eye
High above him, there 's a swallow
Winging swiftly through the sky.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
How the winds are laughing
They laugh with all their might
Laugh and laugh the whole day through
And half the summer night.

\beginverse
"Stop complaining, said the farmer,
Who told you it had to be?
Why don't you have wings to fly with
Like the swallow so proud and free?"
\endverse

\beginverse
Calves are easily bound and slaughtered
Never knowin' the reason why
But whoever treasures freedom
Like the swallow you'll learn to fly.
\endverse
