\beginverse
O flower of Scotland
When will we see yer likes again
That fought and died for
Yer wee bit hill and glen.

\textbf{Refrain}
And stood against him :
"Who's that!!!"
Proud Edward's army
And sent him homeward
To think again.
\endchorus

\beginverse
The hills are bare now
And autumn leaves lie thick and still
Our land is lost now
That those so dearly held.
\endverse

\beginverse
Those days are gone now
And in the past they must remain
But we can still rise now
And be a nation again.
