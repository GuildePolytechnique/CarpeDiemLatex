\beginverse
Oh, give me a home
Where the buffalo roam,
Where deer and the antilope play.
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antilope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
\endchorus

\beginverse
How often at night
Where the heavens are bright
With the light from the glittering stars.
Have I stood there amazed
And I asked as I gazed
If their glory exceeds that of ours.
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh give me a land
Where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely down the stream.
Where the graceful white swan
Goes gliding along
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.
\endverse

\beginverse
Where the air is so pure
The zephyrs so free,
The breezes so balmy and light,
That I would not exchange
My home on the range
For all of the cities so bright.
\endverse
