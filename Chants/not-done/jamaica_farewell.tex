\beginverse
Down the way
Where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip
On a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
"Ackey" rice,
Salt fish are nice
And the rhum is fine any time of year.
\endverse

\beginverse
Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare
My heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.
\endverse

\beginverse
Down the way
Where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip
On a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.
\endverse
