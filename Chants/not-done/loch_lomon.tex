\beginverse
By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon',
Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
Oh ye'll take the high road,
And I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye,
But me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.
\endchorus

\beginverse
'T was that\footnote where we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomon'
Where in deep purple hue,
The Highland hills we view,
And the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.
\endverse
\footnote{Variante : I mind}

\beginverse
The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring,
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping;
But the broken heart it kens
Nae second spring again,
And the world doesn't know how we're greeting.
\endverse
