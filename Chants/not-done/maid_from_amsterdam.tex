\beginsong {The maid from Amsterdam} [
ititle= {Maid from Amsterdam (The)}]

\beginverse
In Amsterdam there lived a maid,
Mark well what I do say!
In Amsterdam there lived a maid,
And she was mistress of her trade.
I'll go no more a-roving with you fair maid!
\endverse

\beginchorus
A roving, a roving,
Since roving's been my ru-i-in,
I'll go no more a roving,
With you fair maid!
\endchorus

\beginverse
I met this fair maid well after dark,
Mark well what I do say!
I met this fair maid well after dark,
And took her to my favourite pub
I'll go no more a roving with you fair maid!
\endverse

\beginverse
I asked this maid to take a walk,...
That we might have some private talk...
\endverse

\beginverse
I put my arm around her waist...
...Sez she, "Young man, yer in great haste!"...
\endverse

\beginverse
I put my hand upon her knee,...
...Sez she, "Young man, yer rather free!"...
\endverse

\beginverse
I put my hand upon her thigh,...
...she says, "Young man, yer rather high!"...
\endverse

\beginverse
I put my hand yet higher still...
...She says, "Young man, that's quite a thrill"...
\endverse

\beginverse
She swore that she'd be true to me...
...But she spent me money for asking free
\endverse

\beginverse
And when I come back home from sea...
...A soldier had her up his knee...
\endverse
