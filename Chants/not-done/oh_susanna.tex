\beginverse
I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee,
I'm going to Louisiana,
My true love for to see.
It trained all day, the night I left
The weather was so dry
The sun so hot I froze myself
Susanna, don't you cry.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
Oh! Susanna
Oh! Don't you cry for me,
For I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee.
\endchorus

\beginverse
I had a dream the other night,
When ev'rything was still,
I thought I saw Susanna there
Acoming down the hill,
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth,
The tear was in her eye.
I say: "I'm coming from the South,
Susanna don't you cry."
\endverse

\beginverse
I soon will be in New Orleans
And then I'll look all 'round
And when I find Susanna,
I'll fall upon the ground
But if I do not find her,
This darkie'll surely die
And when I'm dead and buried
Susanna, don't you cry.
\endverse
