\beginsong{RED RIVER VALLEY} [
ititle={Red River Valley}]

\beginverse
From this valley they say you are going;
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile;
For they say, you are taking the sunshine,
That brightness our pathway the while.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
Come and sit by my side if you love me;
Do not hasten to bid me adieu;
But remember the Red River Valley
And the one that has loved you so true.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Won't you think of the valley you're leaving;
Oh, how lonely, how sad it will be;
Oh, think of the fond heart you're breaking
And the grief you are coming me to see.
\endverse

\beginverse
As you go to your home by the ocean;
May you never forget those sweet hours;
That we spent in the Red River Valley
And the love we exchanged mid the flowers.
\endverse
