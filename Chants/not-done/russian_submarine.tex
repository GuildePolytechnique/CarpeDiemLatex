In the town where I was born
I once lived but now I'm gone
Because I joined the Russian fleet
And then we sank 500 feet
\endverse

\endchorus

\beginverse
We had a nuke and torpedoes
and then we sailed the Barentz'Sea
What has happened, we don't know
But Mr. Putin won't miss me
\endverse

\beginverse
Now my wife is all alone
She wonders why I don't come home
She sees my name on the TV
And she wonders 'they've not told me'
\endverse
