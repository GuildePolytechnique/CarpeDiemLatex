I met her on a mountain,
There I took her life,
I met her on the mountain,
And stabbed her with my knife.

\beginverse
By this time tomorrow,
Reckon where I'll be,
If it hadn't been for Greeson,
I had been in Tennessee.
\endverse

\beginverse
By this time tomorrow,
Reckon where I'll be,
In some lonesome valley,
A-hanging on a wild oak tree.
