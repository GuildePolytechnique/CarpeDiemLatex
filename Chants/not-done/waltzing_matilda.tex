\beginverse
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
Under the shade of a coolibar tree,
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled:
" You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
\textit{\bis{"Waltzing Matilda,}
	You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"
	And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled:
	" You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"}
\endchorus

\emph{À chaque reprise du refrain, remplacer le troisième vers par le troisième vers du couplet précédent.}

\beginverse
Down came a jumbuck to drink beside the billabong
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee,
And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tuckerbag:
" You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"
\endverse

\beginverse
Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred,
Up rode the troopers - one, two, three;
" Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tuckerbag?"
" You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"
\endverse

\beginverse
Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong,
" You'll never catch me alive!", said he.
And his ghost may be heard as you pass beside the billabong:
" You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Dernier refrain}
\textit{\bis{Waltzing Matilda,}
	" You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"
	And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
	\ter{" You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda with me!"}}
