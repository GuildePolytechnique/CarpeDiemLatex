\beginverse
When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then, hurrah! Hurrah!
The men will cheer, the boys will shout,
The ladies they will all turn out;
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
\endverse

\beginverse
The old church bells will peal with joy, hurrah! Hurrah!
To welcome home our darling boy, hurrah! Hurrah!
The village lads and lasses say,
With roses they will strew the way;
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
\endverse

\beginverse
Get ready for the jubilee, hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give the hero three times three, hurrah! Hurrah!
The laurel wreath is ready now,
To place upon his royal brow;
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
\endverse

\beginverse
Let love and friendship on that day, hurrah! Hurrah!
Their choicest treasures then display, hurrah! Hurrah!
And let each one perform some part
To fill with joy the warrior's heart;
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.
\endverse
