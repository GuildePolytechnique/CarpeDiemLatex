\beginverse
I've been a wild rover for many's a year,
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer;
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\textbf{Refrain}
And it's no nay never,
No nay never no more.
Will I play the wild rover,
No never no more.
\endchorus

\beginverse
I went into an alehousen, I used to frequent,
I told the landlady my money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me: "Nay!
Such custom as yours I can have every day!"
\endverse

\beginverse
I then took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright,
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.
She says: "I have whiskies and wines of the best,
And the words that you told me were only in jest."
\endverse

\beginverse
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done,
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.
And when they've caressed me, as oft times before,
Then I never will play the wild rover no more.
\endverse
